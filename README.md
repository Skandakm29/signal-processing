# Signal Processing Project: EEG Analysis and Feature Extraction

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing EEG (Electroencephalogram) data for various classes of brain activity. It involves:
- Time-domain and frequency-domain signal processing.
- Feature extraction (e.g., Fourier Transform, Wavelet Decomposition).
- Visualization of EEG data for 19 channels over time.
